    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="content">
    <p>
      I'm a front-end (JavaScript) developer with experience using many technologies/languages including: React, Angular, Fetch, HTML, CSS, SQL, and WordPress (including PHP). I have also worked on projects which included React Redux and Redux-Saga, Adobe AEM, Jest, and several other JavaScript libraries in their front ends.</p> 
    <p>
      As a UI Developer for a software consulting firm, I have engaged on several projects for clients ranging from massive companies with over 60,000 employees to start-ups with only a few. Each situation is different and requires working with a new group of stakeholders (each of whom has their own priorities and practices). Consulting has allowed me the opportunity to expand my development skills while relying on my education and training backgrounds to provide clear communication based on each audience.</p>
    <p>  
      I work closely with UX designers, project managers, researchers, other developers, and architects to execute each project within the allocated time, budget, and resources available.</p>
    <p>
      I became a web developer after working as a marketer for an educational software company, a personal trainer, and a high school teacher and coach, and I have leaned on my soft skills acquired from these past roles while improving as a junior-level developer. I like to believe I am a fast learner and I'm constantly working to improve my skills, especially in vanilla JavaScript and React.</p>
