          As a UI Developer for a software consulting firm, I have engaged on
          several projects for clients ranging from massive companies with over
          60,000 employees to start-ups with only a few. Each situation is
          different and requires working with a new group of stakeholders (each
          of whom has their own priorities and practices). Consulting has
          allowed me the opportunity to expand my development skills while
          relying on my education and training backgrounds to provide clear
          communication based on each audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work closely with UX designers, project managers, researchers, other
          developers, and architects to execute each project within the
          allocated time, budget, and resources available.
        </p>

          I became a web developer after working as a marketer for an
          educational software company, a personal trainer, and a high school
          teacher and coach, and I have leaned on my soft skills acquired from
          these past roles while improving as a junior-level developer. I like
          to believe I am a fast learner and I'm constantly working to improve
          my skills, especially in JavaScript, React, and AWS.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have personal interest in art, sports, DevOps, music, and my family.
